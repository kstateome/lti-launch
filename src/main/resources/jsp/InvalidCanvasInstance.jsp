    <h2>Invalid Canvas Instance</h2>
    <p>This application is not configured to use this instance of Canvas.
       If you are using a test instance of canvas, please ensure that this is not
       trying to launch a production instance of the LTI application.
    </p>
    <p>This most often happens after the Canvas test/beta overwrites that happen periodically.
       This Canvas instance may need to be reconfigured to point at the LTI test environment.
